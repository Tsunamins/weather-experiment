A mini weather app project with firebase hosting, firestore and functions connecting to the api at: 
https://www.weatherapi.com

Goal is to retrieve weather data, add to firebase, compare old and new values in the database on subsequent api calls.  Then, create and execute further functions based on changes in the weather data, polling, in effect.  Not necessarily a practical weather example, but I'm building this, in principle, to apply the strategy to my internship project as a possibility of solving a middleware problem.
